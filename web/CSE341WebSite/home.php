               My name is James. I live in Keller, Texas with my wife and four children. Keller is in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, which is nice because you get pretty much anything you need.  The down side is that it can feel a bit crowded sometimes.  I grew up in rural Arizona, so I miss the open spaces now and then.  I enjoy riding my motorcycle, cooking, and online gaming, none of which I have much time for this days.
